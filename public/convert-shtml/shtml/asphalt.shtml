<P>Having been prohibited from congress with my new interesting and innovative friend Terry, I thought--what is a restless six-year-old with an energetic tricycle to do? Answer: head west, young man!</P>
<P>The following day found me sitting on my 'power trike' watching a pair of Shelbourne Street locals crouched by the concrete sidewalk engrossed in what seemed to be some sort of petrochemical field study.</P>
<P>'What're ya doin'?' I enquired.</P>
<P>'Important stuff. Go away!' said one. He had a small piece of cedar shingle in one hand and was attempting to pry loose a chunk of the glistening black tar filling a large crack between two of the concrete paving sections.</P>
<P>'My name's Ron,' I said. 'My mother calls me Ronald.'</P>
<P>'I'm Dawse,' said the one wearing eyeglasses. 'My mother calls me Dawse!' he said with a sly snicker. 'That's Bill,' he said, tilting his head toward his preoccupied friend. I wanted to ask what his mother called him but thought better of it.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Bill had managed to dislodge a chunk of the black gunk slightly smaller than a golf ball. Bits of sand and gravel adhered to it and he was flicking these off.</P>
<P>'Whatta ya do with that stuff?' I asked.</P>
<P> 'We chew it, of course!' he said, looking up at me scornfully.</P>
<P>'You chew it?' I said incredulously.</P>
<P>'That's right, we chew it! You got a problem with that?'</P>
<P>'No, no problem,' I replied, bluffing bravely.</P>
<P>'Here, have this bit, then,' he said. 'Spit on your fingers first so it won't stick.'</P>
<P>Aware that my credibility was at stake, I spat on my fingers, took the gob from the stick and jammed it into my mouth. It tasted as though I had just swallowed a teaspoonful of Lysol (an aperitif with which I was intimately familiar, of course). It took all of my self-control to keep from spitting it out immediately.</P>
<P>'How does it taste?' Bill asked ingenuously. You mean you don't already know? I thought.</P>
<P>'How about you, Dawse?' Bill asked.</P>
<P>'Any time,' Dawse replied confidently. Meanwhile, I was attempting to separate with my tongue the black gob from the bits of gravel and sand that had been adhering to it.</P>
<P>'Wewh, I yedder geb goig,' I said.</P>
<P>'What'd he say?' Bill asked.</P>
<P>'I thinn ee thed ee benner geb goig,' said Dawse, who had taken on a sensibly smaller 'chaw' than I.</P>
<P>&#9;If I had been expecting some kind of compliment from my mother for what I considered to be sophisticated behaviour I was sorely disappointed.</P>
<P>'Good Lord!' she exclaimed the moment I walked into the kitchen, 'What on earth have you got in your mouth?'</P>
<P>'Chewin' tar,' I said defensively. 'All us guys chew it!'</P>
<P>'All what guys?' she cried incredulously. I thought for a moment that she was on the verge of yelling. I couldn't remember my mother yelling.</P>
<P>'Bill and Dawse, my new friends up the way.'</P>
<P>'And where do they get the 'chewin' tar', may I ask?'</P>
<P>'From the cracks in the sidewalk,' I replied blithely. 'From the cracks in the sidewalk?' Now she was yelling. 'Along with all the dog crap and horse manure, no doubt. Well, you can just keep away from your new friends 'up the way',' she said, 'and you can march straight into the bathroom and spit that filthy mess into the toilet!'</P>
<P>Mothers can be so narrow-minded at times, I was thinking as I stood watching my almost perfectly spherical gob of tar sink slowly toward the bottom of the toilet bowl. My teeth remained streaked with black for a while, then brown. Nothing serious.</P>
<P>                                             </P>
