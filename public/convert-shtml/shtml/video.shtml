<h2>A Journey To The South Pacific</h2>
<p>In 1954, Ron went on a journey to the South Pacific. He traveled by air, steamer, and sail boat. He visited Hawaii, New Zealand, Fiji, Tahiti, and several smaller islands, even getting shipwrecked on the island of Tubuai Manu.</p>

<p>The following four videos comprise the original 16mm colour film footage Ron shot while on his epic journey. The sound track has no narration, unfortunately, because when Ron did show the footage in public, he narrated it himself. The film footage was transferred to video in the late 1990s with only Polynesian music on the sound track. For the camera enthusiasts, Ron shot the footage on a A Bolex H16 Reflex spring-wound clockwork16 mm camera, which we still own to this day.</p>
