    <h3 class="storyTitle">NORMAN:</h3>
    <p>Norman Luxton was a Canadian who had sailed with Captain Voss in the early part of the century. Their sailboat was a second hand Indian dugout! He travelled from Banff to Calgary when I spoke to the Chamber of Commerce. His adventures are worth reading about.</p>

    <h3 class="storyTitle">LEW:</h3>
    <p>Lew was doing his tour of duty in the American navy in Hawaii. I meet him when he is acting as sound engineer at the high school football broadcasts and is my drinking buddy. He is instrumental in getting me to the Remembrance on the bombed remains of the U.S.S. Arizona battleship.</p>

    <p>We have a nervous time finding lights to warn passing ships when I go to one of the Caribbean islands to help Bob McCullough sail Echo to the Florida keys.</p>

    <h3 class="storyTitle">CYCLONE:</h3>
    <p>We are overtaken by a major hurricane and I stay on the tiller as first man there. Trying to change hands on the tiller could be disastrous in such seas. We are nearly turned turtle and the mess below is substantial. This was the worst of the storms we encountered.</p>

    <h3 class="storyTitle">RAROTONGA:</h3>
    <p>Life in Rarotonga offers all of the amenities men think of as heaven. Lots of fruit, a leisurely way of life and a plethora of beautiful, accommodating females. I took several days off to walk around the island when it was still uncommercialized. </p>

    <h3 class="storyTitle">SHIPWRECK:</h3>
    <p>Bill has been second-guessed till 'hell wouldn't have it' about the procedure he followed after sighting land. He has an unusual method of keeping watch; which includes taking the compass below and watching it occasionally to be sure the staysails don't backwind. I might not have taken such a leisurely approach, but he is the captain! The argument is moot!</p>

    <h3 class="storyTitle">MAIAO-ITI:</h3>
    <p>Fortunately the regular monthly boat to the island has come and gone but we are squeezed aboard a small boat and taken to Tahiti after a couple of weeks. If there are any young women about on Maiao-iti they are well hidden by the pastor. There isn't much to do on Maiao-iti. Each day the chief browns off two or three groups of four men each to gather wood or net fish or strip copra. The rest of the residents sit around and talk.</p>

    <h3 class="storyTitle">TAHITI:</h3>
    <p>Tahiti was probably more fascinating a hundred years before we arrived there and will probably be changed a hundred years after we left. Pity! Modernization was already beginning to show its ugly face. Whether or not there will still be a Bar Zizou or a Chez Rivnac where we can cool our feet in the sand, or a Moorea Hotel with the same lax rules, it remains for someone else to see.</p>

    <h3 class="storyTitle">MOOREA:</h3>
    <p>I spend two weeks with a family in Moorea after going there to take movies of a complete village dancing. Our cost is two jeroboams of wine.</p>

    <h3 class="storyTitle">AU REVOIR TAHITI:</h3>
    <p>I am given my old room when I check back into the Moorea Hotel in Tahiti. It immediately becomes the headquarters for Louise and a couple of her pals.They have a fetish like most Tahitians and shower two or three times a day. One night I spot Bendix at the wardroom on board the Nordlys. She follows me willingly to the hotel, notwithstanding the loud protestations of Louise. One night I see Louise at the Lido, a barn-like dance palace seven or eight miles from Tahiti. I foolishly become involved in a vicious contretemps with a muscular military type fom North Africa. I leave Tahiti with some reluctance. Louise crys when I leave.

    <h3 class="storyTitle">SC-10:</h3>
    <p>I have the product, have the customer, and merely have the paper work for billing the product. All I have to do is to keep the customers on side.The events that take place in my original plant when there is a cloudburst would qualify for a Laurel and Hardy movie. My laziness in the field results in the movement by shovel of tons of snow.

    <h3 class="storyTitle">N'OLLINS:</h3>
    <p>Bill is able to wangle the old Dodge coupe from his mother in about 1959 and he and I take off, presumably to investigate New Orleans. We make it as far as Salt Lake City before we meet a couple of L.A. sweethearts we decide to cook dinner for. They end up with all of our food in their car trunk. We are convinced that the folks in St. Louis are extremely friendly. They are waving at us for a different reason.

    <h3 class="storyTitle">GOIN' HOME:</h3>
    <p>We pass many pickaninny chidren as we head north from Louisiana. Things haven't changed much since the Civil War as far as we can see. The black neighborhoods in St. Louis are as surly as before. The young men call us 'honkies'.

  <div class="card">
    <h3 class="storyTitle">JOBS:</h3>
    <p>I make the rounds of companies in search of legitmate income but have difficulty restraining myself from telling the sometimes arrogant managers what I think of them. The immediate assistants are hugely amused , no doubt, by my assessments but I am refused employment, presumably as a result of my comments.

    <h3 class="storyTitle">PLASTER:</h3>
    <p>Dutch has purchased a bunch of rubber molds with part of his veteran's allowance. We decided to make Plaster of Paris objects for sale, primarily to the carnivals, who gave them away as prizes. Dutch kept his job with Dr. Ballard or whoever his employer was at the time. I had no job.

    <h3 class="storyTitle">CRAIG:</h3>
    We go to play golf at Jasper in the days before a proper road was finished. As a result the government has D-8s on hand to pull us through the mud holes. A group of us go up in the late 40s. We aren't planning any mischief. We end up by cutting a rather wide swathe.

    <h3 class="storyTitle">SUN VALLEY:</h3>
    <p>Dave is an excellent skier. Since I have delusions of being a competent skier he has no difficulty in convincing me we should take a trip to Sun Valley. I manage to become a member of the would-be skiers who have been both carried up and carried down the mountain at Sun Valley. I still carry scar tissue in my right leg.

  <div class="card">
    <h3 class="storyTitle">BUMPUS:</h3>
    <p>'Bumpus' Woody qualifies as the most interesting individual I have ever known. He walked into the Brazeau country before the railway was built. He is not a professional guide and rounds up his horses andassists Gunner and me on occasion. He does everything contrary to the methods of most guides. He removes his shoes and socks <i>after</i> he has forded a mountain stream.

    <h3 class="storyTitle">MOOSE:</h3>
    <p>'Bumpus' and his son try to get Gunner and me out of our 'mummy' bags in the morning. It doesn't work. It's a reversal of the boy who cried wolf one morning when we are told by 'Bumpus' that we could shoot a moose without leaving the tent.

    <h3 class="storyTitle">JACKIE:</h3>
    <p>Drunk driving was mere bagatelle compared to the stunt Jackie pulled. He was a bit unhappy one night after a night of boozing at the Flying Club. He stole an aircraft and flew it at extremely low level, forcing cars off the road on the Centre Street bridge before crashing into the home of a little old lady. She survived, he didn't.</p>

    <h3 class="storyTitle">BUFFALO:</h3>
    <p>I suppose the members of the Buffalo association would have shown up once a month even if the cold beer and cold cuts weren't free. Most of them were supporters of junior hockey. The behaviour of my group one evening before Christmas we blame on having broached the booze purchased for the Christmas party.</p>

    <h3 class="storyTitle">ACID:</h3>
    <p>I produced a product called ‘Dry Magic’ which drew questions from countries from around the world. In the spring of 1964 I  decided to go around the world to talk to the interested organizations in person. I met my friend John in Holland and he talked me into going to Hamburg to initiate my travels. My demonstration of German is a failure. My visit to an unusual club resuts in disappointment and a hangover of major proportions.</p>

    <h3 class="storyTitle">UMSTEIGEN:</h3>
    <p>My lack of fluency in the German language nearly results in my spending the day in a remote German town. I am astonished when I have a chauffeur supplied by one of the major companies who actually clicked his heels!</p>

    <h3 class="storyTitle">PARIS:</h3>
    <p>The meetings with the Hartmanns from Austrian days are redemptive but my Parisian contacts are virtually useless. I left the following day.</p>

    <h3 class="storyTitle">JO’BURG:</h3>
    <p>I return to England in order to fly to South Africa. The man called Fergie Hamel intercepted me at the airport In Johannesburg and took me to his home. His wife and daughter w>ere vacationing in England. I lie in bed for half an hour trying to figure out where I am. Fergie is well connected in South Africa so I am invited to a business lunch, asked about descending in a gold mine and have a visit to Soweto, where I am treated to a gallon pail of Kaffir beer.</p>

    <h3 class="storyTitle">INDIA:</h3>
    <p>I am battling from day one against the Indians attempting to beat me out of what they refer to as <I>baksheesh.</I> My visit to the Taj Mahal beggars belief. Bearing in mind that I was suffering most of the time from dysentery I feel that I was  justified for a heroic award of some type. Whenever my taxi driver was searching the area for someone who would sell him a tin of oil I would be out in the weeds emptying my eager bowels. Persons reading about  the events surrounding my visit to the Taj Mahal would claim that my description was merely a figment of my imagination. I swear that it is all true.</p>

    <p>Suneeta, the beautiful singer at the hotel, took me and her young sister for ice cream at a popular bar via a horse-drawn carriage. She also gave me some useful advice about the way to deal with the many mendicants that followed me.</p>

    <p>The Blue Mountain people sent me pasha-like to Mahabalipuram in their company car. They were obviously tired of me.</p>

    <h3 class="storyTitle">BANGKOK:</h3>
    <p>I met a young man on the plane who had been hunting for a snow leopard for him and his father’s game farm in Ohio. He has no room reservation so I generously offer him a cot in my room. I am not amused when he ends up offering me a cot in <I>my</I> room. He leaves the follwing morning. A stroll in the evening leads me to a bizarre adventure.</p>
