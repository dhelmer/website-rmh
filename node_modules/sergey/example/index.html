    <p>Sergey is a tiny lil’ static site generator. It’s a progressive tool designed to sit atop your already brilliant
      HTML. In essence, Sergey is <strong>HTML + partials</strong> with slots (named and default!) thrown in for good measure.</p>
    <p>If you’ve ever had to make a change to every header on a totally static website, you’ll know how cumbersome and
      error-prone it is to copy and paste the changes through all the files. That’s where Sergey comes in. Sergey lets you
      move that header into a single, importable file, and helps you include it everywhere you need it.</p>
    <p><small>Sergey is still in it's infancy, so please report any bugs and suggestions <a href="https://github.com/trys/sergey/issues">here</a>!</small></p>

      <p>This is the tldr; for those au fait with <code>npm</code> packages. There's step-by-step walkthrough a little <a href="#get-started">further down the page</a>.</p>
<pre>
<code>
$ npm install sergey
</code>
</pre>

      <p counter>Add <code>sergey</code> to your start and <code>sergey --watch</code> to your dev scripts in <code>package.json</code>.</p>
      <p counter>Create an <code>_imports</code> folder, and place a <code>header.html</code> file inside.</p>
      <p counter>Import it into your other files with <code>&lt;sergey-import src="header" /&gt;</code></p>
<pre>
<code>
$ npm run dev
</code>
</pre>
      <p counter>Sergey will start a dev server and watch for any changes.</p>
<pre>
<code>
$ npm start
</code>
</pre>
<p counter>Sergey will create a <code>public</code> folder ready to deploy.</p>

      <h2 id="what-is-sergey">What is Sergey</h2>
      <p>Sergey is a <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">static site generator</a>, albeit, a very basic one. That's intentional. There are some incredible SSG's out there (I'm a big fan of <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">Nuxt</a> and <a href="https://www.11ty.io/">11ty</a>).</p>
      <p>They're all fantastic in their own ways, but also pretty large and in charge. Often when I'm prototyping a website, I don't know if I'll need half the features they offer, nor do I want to spend hours configuring them or reading docs. I just want to get my hands dirty with HTML.</p>
      <p>Sergey is a no-configuration SSG that will render your HTML, include <a href="/#get-started">partials</a>, and render out <a href="/slots/">slots</a>. It'll compile the files and copy your assets into a <code>public</code> folder ready to be Deployed.</p>
      <p>Will it do more in the future? Who knows! Perhaps, but if you need to do more, that's probably a good time to look at some of the illustrious SSG's listed above. Feel free to use Sergey as a springboard, a prototyping tool, or a full-blown production generator. It's up to you!</p>

      <h2 id="get-started">The Hello, World example</h2>
      <p counter>Our starting point is an <code>index.html</code> file.</p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/trys/f8a1732da3032e4e5c6a022467a87e49.js"></script>

      <p>This is lovely, clean HTML. But it becomes problematic when we add a few more pages and need to update the header on
      each page.</p>

      <p counter>Let’s move the header into it’s own file: <code>_imports/header.html</code></p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/trys/6a6dcee76d250d8e8a029cb52e3ddd96.js"></script>

      <p counter>Then we can import it in to our original file with the
      <code>&lt;sergey-import src=“header” /&gt;</code> tag.</p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/trys/5bcb39f31fea3063cec402ed8877c58c.js"></script>

      <p counter>If you’ve already got a <code>package.json</code> file, feel free to ignore this point!</p>
      
      <p>You’ll need to have <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> installed to use Sergey. Once that’s done, open terminal/command line and cd into your
      website directory. Then, run the following command: <code>npm init -y</code></p>

      <p counter>It’s time to install Sergey! Run the command:
      <code>npm install sergey</code></p>

      <p>Now we need to add the build and dev commands to the <code>scripts</code> section of the <code>package.json</code> file. All in all, it should
      look a bit like this:</p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/trys/60f91a425a36a4e0c40d5ac6232748d1.js"></script>

      <p counter>Wonderful! Let’s run Sergey with the command: <code>npm run start</code>. If it’s all gone well, you should have a new <code>public</code> folder
      in your website directory! It should include an index.html file with the original header in place of the
      <code>&lt;sergey-import /&gt;</code>.</p>
      
      <p></p>This public folder is the one to upload to your web server. If you’re deploying via Git (say to Netlify), you can add
      public/ to your .gitignore file.</p>

      <p counter>When you're ready to create a new page, create new folder (say 'about') and place copy of the <code>index.html</code> file in there. That'll become available at <code>yourdomain.com/about/</code></p>
