Sergey is a tiny lil’ static site generator. It’s a progressive tool designed to site atop your already brilliant HTML. In essence, Sergey is HTML + partials with slots thrown in for good measure.

If you’ve ever had to make a change to every header on a totally static website, you’ll know how cumbersome and error-prone it is to copy and paste the changes through all the files. That’s where Sergey comes in. Sergey lets you move that header into a single, importable file, and helps you include it everywhere you need it.
