<P>There was a gap of about fifteen feet between the back of the sheds on the south fence and the fence itself. Soil had drifted up on both sides of the fence to a maximum depth of about four feet. Wonder of wonders, we found two complete automotive steering column assemblies discarded behind the sheds. We immediately commandeered them and used them to rig up 'race cars' in the deep sandy soil along the fence. It was a simple matter of embedding the steering columns and steering wheels in the soft sandy soil, then digging appropriate cockpits behind them so we could sit like race car drivers and with a little imagination be immediately transported to Indianapolis.</P>
<P>'I 'boneys' to be Barney Oldfield!' I said proudly and sat in my vehicle ready to circle the track at high speed. 'Okay,' Lloyd  said, 'then I'll be the Green Hornet!'</P>
<P>'You can't be the Green Hornet!' I said indignantly.</P>
<P>'Why not?'</P>
<P>'Because he's only 'make believe' I protested.</P>
<P>'This whole thing is 'make believe'!' he said. 'What the hell's the matter with you, anyway?' I thought about it for  a moment. 'I guess you're right! You can be anybody you want as far as I'm concerned. Let's get going!' 'Vroom, vroom, vroom...! the juvenile roar of high speed racing cars filled the air behind the forgery for several hours a day for the rest of the week. Saskatchewan schools let out  the following week and we rejoined our cousins back at Uncle's farm. Margaret loaded us into the 1930 Chevy and we were taken back to where the real action took place. There was mischief waiting to be  done.</P>
<P>There were gophers (Richardson's ground squirrels) in every direction, it was just a matter of finding a convenient burrow to set our snare around. Gophers were not particularly difficult to snare. Their natural curiosity seemed to require that they take a peek from just below ground level every few minutes. If they saw nothing moving they would venture further out, a few inches at a time until all of their upper body was exposed. A quick tug on the snare cord and the animal was trapped. The next problem was disposal. One uncle I had would simply step on their heads and crush them. I didn't like this method, partly because, even as pitiless as I was at that age, it seemed just too brutish, especially when I had to listen to the bones in the head of the little animal being crunched.</P>
<P>Swinging snared gophers in a high arc and slamming them against the ground was fatally effective. In some cases one of their eyes would pop out like a little blue button. This didn't bother us particularly but sometimes the snare had become so deeply embedded around the throat it would eventually have to be cut off. Using steel gopher traps was the most utilitarian method. Each trap had a steel chain about a foot and a half long attached to the handle. At the other end of the chain was a tapered steel pin about two inches long that could be driven into a piece of wood to prevent the trapped gopher from retreating far into the burrow. In many cases the gopher was dead by the time we      dragged it to the surface, otherwise, a wide swing to thump it against the ground and the job was nearly complete. There was a two cent bounty on each gopher tail so we pulled  off a section at the end and stuck it in our pocket. We also skinned a gopher occasionally, salted and dried the skin, then attached it to one of our straw hats. Big, macho deal! My major triumph came one year when I trapped a weasel and replaced the inferior gopher skin with the weasel pelt. Fortunately, it was the summer that Joan's sweet young cousin had come up from North Dakota and made it very difficult for me to appear modest with my exotic headgear. Her name was Loretta and I think we were all completely swept off our feet by her. I think it was the year  we were all thirteen or fourteen, including our beloved Loretta, and we were experiencing a variety of unusual feelings toward her.</P>
<P>We had devised another form of sadistic torture to pursue for the demise of the unfortunate gophers when our other methods became uninteresting. This was called 'drownin' 'em out'! It  was disapproved of by Uncle Munro not for humane reasons particularly but because he considered it to be a frivolous waste of water which had to be replaced by the water wagon. Most genetically correct gophers would have inherited the compulsion to continue their burrow on beyond the underground nest and  back up to the surface to provide an emergency escape route  from deadly intruders like snakes and weasels. They still hadn't devised a response for nasty little boys bent on getting them out for a whack on the head. The secondary entrance was usually difficult to find because the gophers had moved all the excavated dirt back throuh the nest to be piled at the front entrance. As a result none of the tell-tale excavated soil was visible, merely a small, inconspicuous hole several yards from the main entrance.</P>
<P>Once we had definitely established the location of the escape exit we posted a 'man' at each hole with an appropriate weapon while two others would carry buckets of water from the 'dugout' in relays. After two or three bucketsful of water we could usually hear gulping sounds from the gopher hole. Another bucket poured and there would be a sopping wet gopher start out of the hole only to duck back down once it saw what was awaiting. One more bucketful usually did it; a sodden gopher would exit one hole or the other and make a run for it. It usually didn't get far; the executioners were poised and the victim was quickly despatched. There was no feeling of sympathy or remorse.It was just a game! I was almost completely desensitized.</P>
<P>One year there was a plague of field mice. Aunt Mabel hated it because they were in the cellar running along the shelves amongst her jars of preserved meat and vegetables; some would scuttle across the floor while dinner was in progress. They were everywhere. In the farmyard we were able to turn over any loose board and see mice running in every direction looking for another hiding place. Some even revealed tiny nests filled with little pink, sightless babies. Naturally, another diabolical game was soon devised. Each time a board was overturned we would clap our straw hats over the refugees and then slide our hats around slowly. As each mouse's tail appeared we would pick it up and carry it to an empty forty-five gallon steel drum where it was deposited for future use.</P>
<P>We had for some time been practising a form of archery. In those days all butcher stores and some other merchants' stores wrapped and tied strings around any purchases made. The string they used came from a large cone-shaped roll sitting on the counter  from which it had been threaded up through an eyelet in the ceiling and hung back down within easy reach of the merchant. When all of the string had been used there remained a small  wooden cone-shaped core of wood on which the string had been  wound. Normally these would have been thrown away but Mike had somehow made a deal with the Chinese store owner in White Bear and had acquired a stockpile of half a dozen of the little hollow wooden cores. The hole through the middle was about an inch in diameter, just large enough to accommodate one of the sharp pointed arrows we had made from cedar shingles. The shingles would split true if we started at the narrow end with  a sharp knife. Then, using the sharp knife again, we could pare down the central portion of the piece, leaving the full width  for about one inch at the thin end of the arrow and gradually sharpening the thick end into a sharply pointed bullet-shaped head. We cut strips of old automobile rubber inner tubes about an inch wide and tacked the ends of an eight inch strip to either side of the hole at the thick end of the discarded wooden string cone. Some of the elitists among us actually flame-hardened  the tips of the arrow heads; a gratuitous but macho practice. If an arrow were loaded and the rubber stretched out to extreme tension it was possible to drive the arrow an inch or more into the side of a granary. But that was not the use for which it was intended.</P>
<P>Wild mice bite when they can, so when we had fifteen or twenty stored in the holding barrel, someone with a glove on would reach into the scrambling mass and grab one of the mice  by the tail and carry it out into the centre of the farmyard.  The victim would usually crouch motionless for a moment or two, during which time it was not considered &quot;cricket&quot; to shoot.  Once oriented, however, the mouse would shoot off in an unpredictable direction. The chase would be on.</P>
<P>         Although the survival rate for the mice was quite low, there was a <U>chance</U>, albeit a small chance, that occasionally a mouse would survive the rain of arrows shot at it as it raced across the farmyard toward the safety of the buildings. Sometimes a mouse would suddenly reverse direction and head back toward the open expanse of the farmyard. That was always fatal. But there was a <U>chance</U>, and we figured that was sufficiently sporting. Years later I had the same philosophical attitude about the bulls in the bullfight plazas of Spain. </P>
<P>&#9;                                          -o-</P>
<P>The successful archer would pull the arrow from the ground, together with its little gray ball of mouse 'shashlik'. Sometimes it could be shaken off with a flick of the wrist, other times it was necessary to push it off with a foot. Normally, one would expect that the killing grounds would be surrounded by a dozen or so watchful cats waiting to seize the fresh corpses, but either they refused to eat dead mice no matter how fresh, or they were glutted already with the existing bounty and were too gorged to show interest.</P>
<P>Although, with our slingshots, we could pick off sparrows perched along the top ridge of a barn or a granary with remarkable skill, environmentalists will be pleased to learn that there was one biological species able to escape our juvenile depredations. There were barn swallows living in one of the granaries and they would swoop and flutter endlessly during the day, presumably catching flying insects. We thought that they would present excellent slingshot targets. We were mistaken! Even when we shot a stone at a hovering swallow from only ten feet away the swallow would adroitly dodge it and return to its station. It was incredible! They seemed to have a bat-like form of radar. The cherry-sized stones coming out of our slingshots must have been travelling at least eighty or ninety miles per hour. It was a challenge we never overcame in spite of standing in the door of the granary for hours on end shooting in vain at the fleet creatures.</P>
<P>'I can't figger out what's happened to that load of washed gravel I bought in the spring to build some foundations,' Uncle Munro said to Aunt Mabel one night at dinner. 'I could swear it's only half the size it used to be.'</P>
<P>'Pass the potatoes, please,' Billy said innocently.</P>
<P>'I could use a little more gravy,' Mike said. Lloyd and I had our eyes fixed on our plates. I was trying to calculate the volume of a hundred or more pocketsful of stones.</P>
<P>Uncle and Auntie had driven to Swift Current one day, leaving Aunt Margaret 'in charge'. Unfortunately it was a day that Lloyd and I had a serious difference of opinion over some presumably minor matter. We also had a slingshot each and pockets full of stones. He was sufficiently angry to have shot and hit me in the leg from a back corner of the house.</P>
<P>'You rotten bastard!' I cried, and shot him in the left knee. Fortunately there was an unwritten law that no one ever shot above the belly button. Even as enraged as we were we continued to abide by the rules but being struck by a stone from a powerful slingshot can be an extremely painful experience. Margaret, alerted by our shouting and cussing came out to see what the problem was. By this time Lloyd and I were circling the house, waiting for a timely shot opportunity. Tempers were at a peak.</P>
<P>'You boys can stop that right now, before someone gets seriously hurt!'</P>
<P>'You'd better be the one that goes in, or you'll be the one getting hurt!' Lloyd shouted. We had both been painfully struck by this time and the shots were vicious.</P>
<P>'You'd better stop or your uncle is going to hear about this!' she yelled back as she disappeared into the house. We decided to call a truce. It was days before the welts disappeared.</P>
<P>Often, long after I had gone to bed, I could hear my aunt and uncle talking quietly in the kitchen while she washed the cream separator parts. In the years to come I would often think of Auntie and wonder if she ever questioned whether it were all worth it. She worked from daybreak until long after we were put to bed at night. Her days were a non-stop series of cooking meals, washing dishes, baking bread, making butter, preserving meat and vegetables, washing  and repairing clothes. The root vegetables had to have the tops trimmed off, as did the carrots, then stored in dry sand in the root cellar. Potatoes were stored in gunny sacks in the house cellar. But she had a loving family most of whom appreciated her when they weren't driving her crazy.</P>
<P>One year I awoke in the morning to the rhythmic sound of water dripping into pots and pans, some located on the bed itself. It had rained during the night for the first time in months and the roof had begun to leak. I never found out if all the rooms suffered but someone, probably Auntie , had risen during the night and gathered up all the available pots and pans and set them in the drip zones.</P>
<P>Whenever Uncle was ploughing or harrowing I would wonder how he could stand the discomfort of wearing 'long johns'. I finally figured it out, all on my own! By wearing long underwear he eliminated the necessity of washing his entire body each night. His hands and face were black from the field dust but he could wash his hands and face much more easily and quickly than his entire body. Constant exposure to the sun had done its dirty work, however, and he eventually developed skin cancer and had radium needles inserted in his lips for a period. The radium treatment was successful but he was a classic 'redneck' for most of his farming life.</P>
<P>When the corn ripened in August Auntie used to cook huge quantities of the cobs to supply the many appetites that convened. I doubt if there was ever sweet corn that made a faster transit from field to kettle. As a result everyone gorged on the delicious corn and salted butter almost to the exclusion of the rest of the marvellous fresh peas and beets and potatoes. Naturally a friendly contest developed to see who amongst the lads could pile up the most kernel-free cobs. Mike was usually the winner, having devoured all the corn from an incredible eight or ten fat corn cobs. Lloyd tried bravely to keep up but was usually second. Billy and I were 'also rans'. The girls didn't count!</P>
<P>Mike was often involved in chores that dirtied him quite effectively but his ablutions used to end just above his wrists. He used to eat his corn with his elbows propped on the table. I can still see the excess melted salt butter that he slathered all over his corn tracking its way down his forearms. When he was told to wash his hands, that's exactly what he did. The clean part rarely extended more than half an inch above his wrists.</P>
<P>At any rate, there never seemed to be a day in summer when the kitchen was not busily active. By 1938 Joan had a little sister they named Mary. She was especially fond of Lloyd, whom she called &quot;Big Boy&quot;. Well, he was a big boy, ending up at six feet four inches tall and 220 pounds when he went into the Canadian Navy. Some days all of the children would sit on the bed in the bedroom just off the kitchen shelling fresh peas. What we didn't eat during the shelling was still enough to keep Auntie busy in the kitchen with Mason jars and boiling water 'putting down' the peas for winter consumption. There were 'pickling' days and 'tiny carrot' days; plums were always available at a certain time and apples were made into sauce, all in Mason jars and stored in the cellar.</P>
<P>I remember that when my mother told me a few years later that Auntie had died I wasn't particularly surprised. I think she was still in her fifties and presumably a victim of some form of cancer that was popular in those days but not much talked about.</P>
<P>'Probably worked herself to death!' I said.</P>
<P>'Yes, poor dear,' my mother said. 'She had a hard life.'</P>
<P>I have no recollection of seeing a church of any kind in the vicinity and there were no special prayers on Sunday. There were travelling evengelists at large, however, and I remember two young men who visited for several days one year to spread the word. I never was sure what denomination they represented but they had us all singing lustily and enjoying religion for the first time. I don't think they got any money for their efforts but they were given a place to sleep, (presumably in the unoccupied hired man's shack), and had three of Mabel's damned good meals every day. The only line I remember from that educational spasm was: '...hide it under a bushel? No!'</P>
<P>I think this was probably the same year that Loretta had come up from North Dakota and organized our social life. Less than a week after her arrival she had established a game of 'Post Office' which was immediately popular. I assume that most people know the way the game is played. Each time the postmaster announced that there was a letter for the next candidate he or she would proceed to the privacy of the post office (our aunt and uncle's bedroom) to receive the mail which was, of course, a kiss! Wow! Loretta received an unusually large number of letters and as a result was frequently postmistress. When she said there was a letter for me I was thrilled.</P>
<P>I had reached puberty by this time so I should have a clearer recollection of the experience, but it seems to have evaporated. Perhaps it was the regimental nature of the routine that cooled my enthusiasm. Had there been a knowledgeable tip of pink tongue involved? I think not. Did the soft sweetness of her lips and the clasp of her slender figure evoke the semblance of an erection? I think not. Either of these desirable occurrences would surely have created a solid fix in my memory, but it seeemed to be lacking. Perhaps it was just a matter of unfortunate timing. A couple of days later we were all sitting in the shade of the house when Loretta blandly stated that the girls in Watford City did <U>it</U> for the boys for twenty-five cents. Maybe I <U>hadn't</U> reached puberty! Otherwise why didn't I try to find out if she meant  that <U>she</U> would do it for twenty-five cents? Why didn't I try to arrange a clandestine meeting for a serious game of 'Double Registered Post Office' sealed with full tongue and possibly genital involvement? It was because I was a jerk, obviously! She was sending me signals but I was looking the other way.</P>
<P>One day Joan and Loretta were given a special treat by being allowed to drive into White Bear with Uncle. Lloyd had a special interest in the outcome of the visit because he had given Lorna ten cents to buy cigarettes at the Chinaman's store. The girls had to conceive a complicated lie so they could sneak back to the store and make the purchase. Unfortunately, Uncle Munro went back to the store himself for a last minute purchase and was gratuitously informed of the girls' purchase by the owner, Mr. Lee. Uncle Munro made no comment on the return trip to the farm.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Lloyd had co-opted Mike into the conspiracy and was looking forward himself to his first satisfying drag in weeks. Lorna was no stranger to the cancer stick herself and was glad to be involved. Billy, Joan and I all chose to abjure but were prepared to be witnesses and soon after the girls' return from town we all drifted out to the back of the machine shed about a hundred yards from the house in what we thought was a casual manner. Lloyd probably looked more like a dope addict craving a fix.</P>
<P>'Loretta! Where are you, Loretta?'</P>
<P>'Rats! It's my Aunt Gertrude,' Loretta said. </P>
<P>Gertrude was Auntie's sister and had come as a guardian for Loretta when they travelled up from North Dakota. We never did meet Loretta's parents. Loretta had been about to inhale her first drag but stopped and carefully knocked off the glowing end of the cigarette and returned it to Lloyd.</P>
<P>'Great timing!' she said dryly. 'I wonder what the heck she wants.' Gertrude was in a mood to maximize Loretta's discomfort.</P>
<P>'What were you doing out there?' she asked.</P>
<P>'Just talking,' she said, shifting nervously from one foot to the other. Her aunts and her uncle were seated comfortably at the kitchen table. What's with the third degree? she thought to herself. I wonder if they're going to torture me? She'll probably be smelling my breath next, she thought cynically. It's a good thing I didn't take that first drag.</P>
<P>'Let me smell your breath,' Gertrude said. I knew it! Loretta thought.</P>
<P>'Smell my breath? Why would you want to do that, for goodness sake?'</P>
<P>Gertrude felt she was holding all the cards. 'We just thought you might have been smoking,' she said casually.</P>
<P>'Smoking?' she said incredulously. 'I have not, definitely!' At least she didn't have to cross her fingers behind her back, she thought.</P>
<P>'Do you swear?'</P>
<P>'I swear! Cross my heart and hope to die!'</P>
<P>'Your uncle says you and Joan bought a package of cigarettes at the store in White Bear.'</P>
<P>'How would he know that?'</P>
<P>'Because the Chinaman told him. A ten cent package of Sweet Caporals, apparently.' Gertrude said triumphantly.</P>
<P>'And he believed him, I suppose?' Loretta said indignantly.</P>
<P>'I'm afraid it's true, dear' Uncle Munro said. 'He would have no reason to lie.'</P>
<P>The dirty little tattle-tale! Loretta thought, but she realized that further denial was pointless. 'Buying's one thing, smoking is another. I just bought them for a friend,' she said.</P>
<P>'So who was your friend? Gertrude asked.</P>
<P>'One of the boys!'</P>
<P>This is like pulling teeth, Uncle thought. 'Maybe you should go out and ask the the boys to come on in,' he said. Loretta walked back out to the machine shed looking like the recently bereaved.</P>
<P>'What was all that about?' Lloyd asked.</P>
<P>'The cigarettes, I'm afraid,' she replied.</P>
<P>'The cigarettes? But how could they possibly know, you  said you and Joan were alone when you bought them.'</P>
<P>'Apparently Lee told Uncle when he went into the store again. I'm afraid they've got us dead to rights,' she said glumly.</P>
<P>'That rotten little bastard!' Lloyd said.</P>
<P>'He probably thought he was doing Dad a favour,' Joan said. 'He knows which side his bread is buttered on!'</P>
<P>'See if we ever buy cigarettes from him again!' I said, and we all laughed sardonically. Then we marched in to the house where Lloyd owned up to his culpability. He had managed to smoke one cigarette while Lorna was undergoing questioning but handed over the rest of the package to Mike for 'safekeeping'.</P>
<P>'I didn't know it was against the law,' Lloyd said in his own defense.</P>
<P>'Actually it isn't against the law,' Uncle  Munro told him. 'It's against our rules, though. We think it creates too much of a fire hazard.'</P>
<P>'Yeah, right!' Lloyd said unhappily.</P>
