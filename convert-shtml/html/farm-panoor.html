<P>I can't remember exactly how old I was when we made our first summer trip to stay with our cousins in Saskatchewan but if I had to guess I'd say I was five. I was born with a right inguinal hernia and was required to wear a silly little truss with a snap-on red sponge pad to keep the hernia from protruding (theoretically).  Try to visualize nailing a raw egg to a barn door and you'll realize how much chance there was for the sponge to stay in place for an active child. I know there was one year when the other boys were jumping from the top of the barn to the top of the haystack and from the door of the loft to the ground and I was forbidden to do any of these exciting things because of my 'condition'. I wore the accursed device when I went to school one year so I'm guessing that I was patched up after my first year at school.</P>
<P>The hernia was surgically repaired at the old Calgary General Hospital during my seventh year. My mother took pleasure from relating the story of my emergence from the anaesthetic. She was sitting beside the bed when our family doctor entered the room to check on my progress. Before he had a chance to say anything I beat him to the punch, much to my mother's intense embarrassment.</P>
<P>'Goddam you, Dr. Maxwell, I'm never going to speak to you again!' I stated indignantly. He just stood at the bottom of the bed and laughed heartily.</P>
<P>'I came to see how you were feeling,' he said, 'but I assume from your comments that you're doing fine!' he said and walked out of the room, still chuckling.</P>
<P>'I don't know what he thinks is so funny!' I said, feeling miffed. My mother couldn't restrain a slight smile as she responded.</P>
<P>'He thinks it's funny because his name is Dr. Francis. Dr. Maxwell is our family dentist!'</P>
<P>'Oh!' I said,</P>
<P>'And I don't know what ever came over you to talk that  way to the doctor!' she said. 'You should be ashamed of yourself!'</P>
<P> I <U>was</U> ashamed of myself; I had thrown away what I considered to be a good line.  I was late getting to Saskatchewan that year and there was still no 'high-jumping'. I don't know what kind of arcane arrangement my folks made with Munro and Mabel each summer but they never stuck around for more than a day or two. In fairness I guess my Dad had his baseball team and his billiard parlour to manage but if we had been the sensitive type we would have had the feeling we had been 'dumped'.</P>
<P>It wasn't a bad deal, actually, because our cousins were virtually the same ages as Lloyd and me. Billy, the younger,  was my age and Michael (known to the family as 'Mike') was Lloyd's age. Even after we had visited every year for several years there was still a short period of shy embarrassment when we first arrived in our Uncle's farmyard and stepped out of the car. Naturally we would hug and kiss Auntie and kiss Uncle but then we would stand around, awkward and speechless for a while until one of our cousins suggested a diversion. Joan, younger than Billy by a couple of years, would have been crying throughout our arrival. I assumed it was from joy and excitement.</P>
<P>I think Billy was 'snake-bit' when it came to introductory demonstrations. His preferred victims seemed to be the setting hens from the henhouse. Setting hens tend to be extremely cross and defensive when approached,</P>
<P>'Just reach in there and grab it by the legs,' Billy would say with a wide apprehensive smile, knowing full well what the result would be. As soon as our hand was within striking distance the targeted hen would peck viciously at it. More as a result  of surprise than pain it would be hurriedly withdrawn.</P>
<P>'You've got to be assertive,' Billy would say with a laugh. He would then thrust his hand in under a hen, ignoring the harassing henpecks and drag the loudly complaining bird from its hutch.</P>
<P>'I'll bet you guys didn't know chickens could swim,' he would say importantly, heading for the &quot;dugout&quot; The 'dugout' was exactly what its name implied, a huge pit dug out of the  ground west of the windbreak to provide a storage reservoir for watering the animals and watering the garden during drought  periods. This was a drought period.</P>
<P>Half way to the 'dugout' on our triumphal march to our destination Bill suddenly stopped. 'Aw, shit!' he exclaimed.</P>
<P>'What's wrong?' Lloyd asked. We all assumed the hen had crapped in his hand.</P>
<P>'The stupid thing laid an egg!' Billy replied.</P>
<P>'I thought that was its job!' I said gratuitously. It drew an angry glance from the showman.</P>
<P>The hen's unexpected contribution seemed to have broken Billy's concentration. 'Aw, the hell with it!' he said. 'It  can find its own way home!' He fully expected, as we all did when he hurled the bird high in the air, that it would spread its wings and flutter back to the henhouse. But it didn't; It  acted as though hypnotized, and with its wings tucked tightly to its sides, described a lovely parabolic flight through the air, landing with a heavy thud, breaking its neck in the process. Like mothers everywhere, Auntie seemed to have second sight and suddenly appeared in her kitchen apron at the edge of the barnyard.</P>
<P>'What in Heaven's name do you think you're doing?' she  said angrily to Billy.</P>
<P>Billy, a blonde, had blushed deep red by this time. 'I  was just going to show the boys how chickens could swim!' He  was about to add that the stupid hen had laid an egg, but thought better of mentioning it.</P>
<P>'I don't suppose you had the wit to bleed it so we could  at least eat it!' she cried.</P>
<P>'I forgot,' Billy replied sheepishly.</P>
<P>'I'm not surprised,' she said, turning back toward the house. 'Stupid, stupid boy!' she muttered angrily. As she disappeared around the corner of the house Billy turned and hurled the fresh egg as far into the plowed summer fallow as he could.</P>
<P>'What'd you do that for?' Lloyd asked. I was also amazed.</P>
<P>'Out of sight, out of mind!' Billy said with a smile. I finally figured out that he had wisely decided that to present the egg to his mother would open up the unpleasant situation once again. The mishap put a damper on Billy's plan for a 'gang-buster' opening reception but it was soon forgotten and we were directing our activities to other mischief.</P>
<P>My mother's father, whom we called 'Grampa' lived in a nice old farmhouse a mile south and half a mile west of Uncle's farmhouse. He never married again until all his girls and his only son were married, but raised them all himself. I stilll think of him as a modern-day hero. After they were all settled he married Mrs. Johnson, a childhood friend who had been widowed years before. Whenever Mrs J. was asked to stay with us for a few days to 'babysit' we looked forward to it. Why? Because Mrs. J had a supply of genuine maple syrup candy, some of which we would get each night if we'd behaved ourselves during the day.</P>
<P>A visit to Grampa's for a few days after our yearly arrival was mandatory; His house was on a rise of land allowing a view for miles around. Uncle's place could be seen readily by looking to the northeast. Straight west across the road opposite the turnoff that led in to Grampa's place was a run-down two-story house occupied by an old bachelor called Joe Cokes. A visit to Joe's house was a memorable experience. The doorway to one of the main floor bedrooms had been boarded off to a height of about five feet so that the room served as a storage granary, and was bulging with wheat.</P>
<P>Joe was of medium height, balding, and looked like he shaved once a week or so without fail. There was a wen half the size of a chicken's egg on the top of his head. One day Lloyd and  I were sent down to Joe's on some sort of errand. He was out  in the yard splitting wood for the stove, clad only in a worn pair of bib suspenders, no shirt and obviously no underwear. The inside seam on one leg of the overalls was split from bottom  to crotch. Every time Steve set up a section of wood to split  and took a full swing at it with the axe, an overall leg would fly to one side and expose Steve's hairy balls dangling down  between his legs. Lloyd thought this was sensational and could  hardly wait to get back to Uncle's place to relate the story to his cousins.</P>
<P>I had a good look around when we went into the house with Steve to pick up the coal oil or whatever it was we had been sent for. There were chickens roosting atop what had presumably been bookshelves at one time. Now the shelves were stuffed with small canvas bags containing grain samples. Naturally, the sink was filled with dirty dishes and a greasy frying pan. There  was a faint acrid stench pervading the room which I finally  realized was the smell of chicken shit. I decided then and there  that I would live at home with my mother until I was able to get married to some neat girl.</P>
<P>One summer we attended the Annual Picnic and Field Day at a lovely wooded park down by the South Saskatchewan River.  They had potato sack races, egg and spoon races, three-legged races and so on. One contest they had was new to me; they put  two empty forty-five gallon steel drums next to each other then picked out two boys who looked to be about the same size. They were then outfitted with boxing gloves and lifted into the steel drums. On the signal 'Go' the boys would start flailing away at each other at will. I was mismatched with a sturdy farmboy I guessed outweighed me by close to twenty pounds, at least that was my  conclusion after he had pounded me nearly senseless and was declared the winner.</P>
<P>          The gentleman busily in charge of all these events was clean-shaven, hair neatly greased and combed and he was wearing a shirt and tie, a vest and suit, and a fedora hat. 'Who in hell is that officious old buggger, anyway?' I asked Mike. 'Didn't you recognize him?' Mike said with a chuckle. 'That's old Steve Cokes!' You could have knocked me down with  a feather.</P>
<P>Years later, just before he retired and moved to Saskatoon, Uncle Munro visited us in Calgary. He claimed to have had an unusual experience the previous winter. It had been cold the previous December in Saskatchewan, which, in Saskatchewan is <U>very</U> cold. He said he had seen no sign of activity around Steve Cokes's farmhouse for several days. He had not been notified that Steve was planning to be away so decided to drive in and check on him. When he entered the unlocked farmhouse there was no heat, in fact, he said, frost had begun to form on the stovepipe. There was no sign of Steve in the kitchen area other than a red hen strutting amongst and pecking at the few bits of dried food on the unwashed dinner plates on the table.</P>
<P>When he entered the bedroom he found Steve lying on the  bed in his dirty long underwear, partially covered by a patchwork quilt and with one unwashed bare foot sticking out from under the covering.</P>
<P>'I swear I thought he was dead,' Uncle Munro said. 'I figgered he'd either had a heart atttack or just plain frozen to death!  I felt around his wrist and finally found a pulse, though, so I covered him properly then went back into the kichen and got the fire going. After washing his face and getting a couple  of cups of tea in him I had him sitting up looking like he might  live. By the time I left he'd put his teeth back in and was  looking right as rain.'</P>
<P>'So he's still alive, then,' my mother said.</P>
<P>'So far as I know,' he said with a chuckle.</P>
<P>'If it hadn't been for you he'd probably have frozen to death, silly old fool!' Mom said. 'Quite possible,' Uncle said.</P>
<P>'If he had died he wouldn't have been neglected indefinitely, at least' Lloyd interjected.</P>
<P>'Why do you say that?' Mom said.</P>
<P>'Well, it just stands to reason, doesn't it? When he thawed out in the spring, eventually someone downwind would have smelled him and gone to investigate!' All he received for his attempt at levity was a couple of reproving looks from his elders.</P>
<P>'What a disgusting thought!' Aunt Margaret said. I, on the other hand, thought it was rather amusing.</P>
<P>Some years Aunt Margaret spent a month or two at the farm, living in the farmhouse on the hill with Grampa. I think on these occasions the school children in Saskatchewan had not started their summer holidays. This timing may have had something to do with the harvest routine in Saskatchewan. We could always tell when school was out for the day, however; walking home  from the schoolhouse the kids would throw high in the air the lids of the lard pails in which they had carried their lunch. The object, of course, was to see how far down the road they could sail them, but as they swooped to one side or the other the polished bottom sides of the lids would catch and reflect the sun, making them visible for miles. Sudden flashes like daytime shooting stars! Sometimes Lloyd and I would hop on the bikes and race to meet them at the road intersection.</P>
<P>If Lloyd and I and Margaret were the only visitors at Grampa's farm it was my boyhood dream of going to heaven on earth. No one called us to get up in the morning and even though we were normally awake by nine we could lie and daydream till we felt  like moving. One morning I was awakened from a deep sleep by a loud shotgun blast. I jumped out of bed, pulled on my cut-off  jeans (my entire raiment for the day), and ran barefoot out of the hired man's shack where we slept. Grampa was walking toward the fence beyond the barn, carrying a large chicken hawk by one wing. I ran to catch up with him.</P>
<P>'I only heard one shot , Grampa!' I said.</P>
<P>'Only takes one,' said Grampa laconically.</P>
<P>'Boy, that's some kinda shooting, Grampa! What'd he do?'</P>
<P>'This old bugger's just stolen three of my chickens since this spring, but he's stolen his last one now!'</P>
<P>'What're ya gonna do with him now?'</P>
<P>'I'm going to string him up on that there barbed wire fence. Maybe it'll serve as a warning to his friends.'</P>
<P>'Does that really work?'</P>
<P>'So they say. Anyway, run in now and get some breakfast from your Aunt Margaret, and don't ask so damn many questions.'</P>
<P>If anyone were looking today for a typical self-sufficient farm of the early part of the century, they would be heartbroken to think they had not made a deal before Grampa's farm was broken up. The farmyard itself was fenced in with three-strand barbed wire, presumably to keep pastured farm animals from wandering around near the house. They seemed to be effective in spite of the fact that the drifting soil caused by the drought had  piled up on either side of the fences so that theoretically any animal so inclined could easily walk up one side and down  the other. It was all caused by a nasty natural synergism;  tumbleweeds would break off from their roots in the autumn and roll across the prairie driven by the wind until they were trapped by a wire fence, then would act as a perfect sand fence to allow the buildup.</P>
<P>Immediately next to the house was a concrete-lined cistern which held the drinking water for the house. A bucket on a rope was dropped down and flipped until it fell over and filled with water which was then hauled up, the cistern cover replaced and the water taken inside. I can still see Grampa frowning his disapproval when he was in Calgary and we would fill the basin with water just to wash our hands. This was borderline intolerable to one who had pumped and hauled by horse-drawn tank every cupful of water for the house from a river eight miles away.</P>
<P>'Are you going for a swim, then?' he would ask sarcastically before walking away shaking his head.</P>
<P>There was a community 'dugout' a mile north of Grampa's place which held water suitable for the animals and Grampa rigged up one day to take the water wagon to be filled. I begged him to take me along and he was easily convinced by an eight year old. Accordingly, he took off with a happy child seated on top of the wooden tank. He was able to fill the tank with water while I sat in  privileged approval on top of the wagon. When he had filled the tank he climbed back to his seat and snapped the reins for the horses. The horses took off with an abrupt jerk and I did a back flip off the back of the tank. Unfortunately, not being a profesional gymnast, I managed to land with one of my arms twisted under my body. I think no one could have been more distressed than my Grampa without actually crying. He felt that the accident was his fault and the responsibility was all his. I enjoyed all of the attention until the sling came off.</P>
<P>The first building next to the fence that ran along the south side of the farmyard was a forge and harness repair shop. The harness for a full team of huge Belgian or Clydesdale plough horses was extremely complex and was subject to frequent breakage. Making it more stout would minimize breakage but make it so heavy it would put additional strain on the horses and also make it virtually impossibley for one man to harness a team. Running to a harness-maker in town was time consuming and impractical, even if one had existed. As a result the prairie farmer became virtually self-sufficient. The same situation prevailed for the repair or replacement of iron and  steel strapping, struts or bracing and we were always excited  when the forge was lighted up and we were allowed to turn the crank on the blower that forced air to the coke glowing in the forge.</P>
<P>The next three buildings leading along the fenced area  were storage granaries. One year we arrived to discover there was a litter of kittens living beneath the farthest granary and made interminable hopeless efforts to lure one of them within reach. But they were completely feral, as wild as forest deer and impossible to tame. It was probably just as well, saving us from innumerable scratches and bites. Grampa encouraged their existence since they were presumably subsisting entirely on wheat-eating vermin like gophers (supplied by 'Mom-cat') and mice.</P>
<P>One summer day Lloyd and I were standing outside the main door to the barn when Grampa emerged sitting atop a heavily-loaded two-wheeled cart pulled by one of the plough horses.</P>
<P>'What're ya doin', Grampa?' Lloyd enquired.</P>
<P>'I'm just taking this load over to the manure dump in the south field,' he replied. He had obviously just spent a couple of hours swamping out the barn stalls.</P>
<P>'Can we go with ya?' Lloyd asked. 'We could ride up top!'</P>
<P>'It's a load of manure,' Grampa said. 'If you get up here you're just going to get all covered with shit!' We never let on that we were shocked; we had always assumed that Grampa would never say 'shit' if he had a mouth full of it!</P>
<P>'But we just love 'panoor' Lloyd said assertively. It was the first I'd ever heard about it.</P>
<P>'Why don't you just trail along behind? It's not very far, then maybe you can ride back with me after I've dumped this load.'</P>
<P>'Okay,' Lloyd said reluctantly. So we trotted along behind the aromatic load until we arrived at the dumping ground. After the load was dumped Grampa helped Lloyd climb up beside him for the ride back. I chose to walk. Frankly, I just didn't love 'panoor' as much as Lloyd claimed he did. Lloyd had to live for years with the family quoting his great line: 'We just love 'panoor', Grampa!'</P>
