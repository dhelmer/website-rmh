<P>Colour postcard of Johannesburg (The City of Gold) with long panoramic view from Albert Herzog Tower. Huge yellow dumps of mine tailings across the landscape.                                                       </P>
<P>                                                                        Monday, March 23rd, 1969</P>
<P>Hi dear;</P>
<P>            I can hardly believe it myself, but the weather really is just like it looks in this photo. About 75 degrees above today. The city is 6500 feet above sea level so it cools nicely in the evening just like Calgary. I had my first good night of sleep in some time last night. It's a great relief to get away from the rain and cold of Europe and into the sun again. Looks like a fun-type sunshiny week. Kiss my little ones!</P>
<P>                                             Much love,     Ron</P>
<P>  I must have gone by the Hotel Astor to pick up my mail.</P>
<P>AEROGRAMME        To:    Mr. Ron Helmer</P>
<P>                                           Hotel Astor,</P>
<P>                                           JOHANNES BURG,</P>
<P>                                           South Africa</P>
<P>                                                                      Saturday, March 21, 1964</P>
<P>                                                                      10:00 p.m.</P>
<P>Howdy;</P>
<P>Thought I'd make sure you got two letters in Johannesburg. What a day I've had. In fact it all started yesterday. Before I tell you about it, everything now is quite O.K. Anyway, Dougie caught his finger in the front door and he has one pretty stitch. I'm really not sure how serious it was as I took one look at the blood and wrapped him up, sent Gretchen to Montgomery's, told Sharon to hold him and drove over to Dr. Brown's office. The bone was not hurt but there was lots of blood and I could see it was no scratch. By the way, it was his little finger on the left hand. Anyway, he's just fine. I can say that with my quick thinking not more than ten minutes elapsed before he was sterilized and sewn. Imagine one stitch. I think I may cry. He woke up twice last night and woke up and opened his big eyes and big mouth at 6 a.m. And the pet refused to sleep at naptime so it's been a long day. It's after eleven o'clock so will sign off now. Sure miss you.</P>
<P>                                              Love, love, love</P>
<P>                                                    Jean</P>
<P>      </P>
<P>                                                        -o-</P>
<P>It was dificult to tell the age of Margaret, the black servant at Fergie's home. I guessed she was about thirty-five years old but she could easily have been five years older or younger. She did not live 'in' but presumably came early enough in the morning to prepare breakfast and stayed long enough at night to serve the dinner she had prepared and to clean up the kitchen afterward.</P>
<P>This evening she had prepared a beef stew with mashed potatoes and gravy and Fergie had opened a bottle of good South African red wine. The stew was well-seasoned and tasty. Margaret came shuffling from the kitchen when we were less than half-finished our meal.</P>
<P>'You might as well go home now, Margaret,' Fergie said to her.</P>
<P>        </P>
<P>'Was everything all right, mastah?'</P>
<P>'Lovely, dear, very tasty!'</P>
<P>'You gennelmen gonna want dessert?' she asked. 'I got tinned peaches and ice cream in the 'fridge''</P>
<P>'Great!' Fergie said, 'We'll serve ourselves if we want some!' Fifteen minutes later Margaret opened the kitchen door part way; she was carrying a plastic shopping bag in one hand.</P>
<P>'I'm goin' home now, Mistah Hamel,' she said.</P>
<P>'Goodnight, Margaret, see you tomorrow!'</P>
<P>'I noticed the shopping bag,' I said when she had gone.</P>
<P>'It's a traditional 'perk',' Fergie said with a chuckle. 'We don't pay them much, but we turn a blind eye to anything they take home from the kitchen. She has a husband and two kids still at home so I guess we're feeding six or more mouths when you think about it!' </P>
<P>Fergie rinsed off our dishes then cracked open a bottle of brandy when we finished supper. It was after ten when Fergie showed me to my bedroom upstairs. The combination of booze and jet lag combined to make me dog-tired and I slept soundly till morning.</P>
<P>When I woke up the room was bright with sunshine but there was virtually nothing to remind me where I was. Where the hell was I? I'd  had brief moments of disorientation in the past but they had been momentary and I had soon figured out where I was and why. In this case, however, I lay motionless for some time trying to remember the previous day. I looked around the room but the walls were bare and gave me no clue  to my whereabouts. There was no telephone, ergo--no 'phone book to use as a clue. I finally got up and reached for my shoulder bag; according to my itinerary I was at the Astor Hotel in Johannesburg. South Africa! That was it! It all suddenly came flooding back to me---the pickup at the airport, the dinner with Fergie Hamel, the brandy and soda! I was quite unsettled when I realized how completely I'd forgotten the events of the previous twenty-four hours! I'd been inadvertently brain-washed! I thought of the Manchurian Candidate!</P>
<P>'The annual exhibition is on at the Fair Grounds,' Fergie said while I had a  breakfast of bacon and eggs. He had finished breakfast and was sitting in a lounge chair reading the morning paper.</P>
<P>'Are you planning to go there?' I asked .</P>
<P>'I've seen it before, of course, but I think you'd enjoy it.'</P>
<P>'Damn!' Fergie said as we neared the fairgrounds, 'I have a parking pass but I left it in my briefcase back at the house. Ah well, to hell with it!' There was a tall Boer security guard standing at the gate to the private parking area when we pulled up.</P>
<P>'Could I see your parking pass, please?' he said with a strong South African Dutch accent.</P>
<P>'I  forgot it! Don't you have a list?' Fergie said testily. His face had reddened perceptibly.</P>
<P>'I have no list,sir. I can't let you park here without a pass, I'm afraid.'</P>
<P>'I've been parking here for years!' Fergie protested.</P>
<P>'Sorry, sir, I'm not able to let you enter!'</P>
<P>Fergie's face was now beet red. 'The hell you aren't!' he said furiously, slamming the car into gear and driving quickly into the parking lot. I looked back and saw the guard staring after us unbelievingly.</P>
<P>'Stupid fucking Boer!' Fergie said, parking the car as his anger began to diminish. I had witnessed the display in silent wonder at Fergie's sudden angry outburst but realized as the week went on that Fergie nursed a smouldering resentment of officious Boers in positions of authority.</P>
<P>I have only one recollection from the exhibition after all these years and it is comprised of the display of cut diamonds. I presume some of the bigger stones had been sent to Amsterdam for cutting and polishing and then returned to Beers or whoever owned them and was displaying them.</P>
<P>Fergie arranged for me to attend a luncheon of the leading companies operating in South Africa. I was introduced by the chairman and asked about my reason for a visit to their country. I used the opportunity to make a plug for &quot;Dry Magic&quot;. After lunch I was approached by a young Boer who worked for I.C.I. (Imperial Chemical Industries) and asked if there was anything I would like to do during my visit. I told him I would like to visit the Bantu town at Soweto (they referred to the blacks as Bantu) and he said he would try to arrange it. In the meantime he would take me on a sightseeing trip of the gold mines.</P>
<P>I had been down a deep anthracite coal mine near the McLeod River in the late fifties so declined his offer to go down the pit at Witwatersrand. I was interested to note his condescending attitude toward the Bantu. </P>
<P>'See how they do this?' and 'See how they do that?' he said, more in the manner of a patronizing adult treating with little children than of pure contempt. He told me more than once that the Dutch had settled the south of Africa long before the Bantu had arrived and therefore they were entitled to their preeminent position in the social order. I felt that it smacked of arrogance.</P>
<P>The following day I was taken to his office and introduced to Margit, the Afrikaner who was to escort me to Soweto. She was about thirty years of age and not unattractive and spoke English in the unusual combination of accents of Afrikaans and South African. We were driven out to Soweto by a liveried black gentleman in a luxurious limousine and were required to disembark and present our pass at the entrance to the settlement. This was all part of the Apartheid policy that was being enforced at that time. Our driver would wait for us at the gate.</P>
<P>As we walked slowly down the street between the rows of neat houses Margit spoke enthusiastically of how much better off were the Bantu living here. Each concrete block dwelling had a living room, a kitchen, a bathroom and two bedrooms. They were all identical. I perceived a strong yeasty odour as we approached the centre of the settlement.</P>
<P>'Smells like a brewery,' I said.</P>
<P>'That's exactly what it is,' Margit said. 'Each resident is allowed a daily gallon of beer and he has to supply his own bucket'. She pointed to a couple of men about to enter the 'brewery'. 'Those are gallon pails those men are carrying; they can take beer home but the authorities prefer to have them drink here.' Shades of 1984!</P>
<P>We entered a building that had a desk with a security guard who took down the men's names then did the same for us. Behind that was a room holding a huge stainless steel tank where the beer was brewed. Another security man filled each of the buckets from a draw-off tap low on the side of the tank.</P>
<P>'It looks like that stuff is still fermenting,!' I said.</P>
<P>'It is!' Margit said. 'It's Kaffir beer; they only ferment it for twenty-four to forty-eight hours! Do you want some?'</P>
<P>'I guess I'll pass,' I said, thinking of my sensitive bowels. The thought of  semi-fermented Kaffir beer sloshing about in my belly made me think I'd be lucky to make it back to town without a sanitary disaster. We passed through the last doorway and found ourselves in an amphitheatre with ten or twelve rows of  benches formed into a semicircle. In spite of the earliness of our visit there were half a dozen small groups of Bantu men scattered around the amphitheatre. We found a shaded spot up near the top of the benches and sat down for a while to chat.</P>
<P>'Do you reckon all these lads are happy in the service?' I asked.</P>
<P>'It's hard to say; these are mostly men who have chosen to live away from their kraals in the first place. I know it seems militaristic in many ways but everything here is priced right and they really are not harassed to the same degree they would be in town. The Bantu are mostly proud people and they resent being told where and when to go. Incidentally, I have some other work to do here so I won't be going back to town with you. I'll walk with you back to the main gate and see you off, though.'</P>
<P>We walked back to the main entrance and were checked out then I thanked her for her time and interest and climbed back into the waiting limousine. The driver's proper name was Nkome but he preferred to be called Napoleon.</P>
<P>'Have you ever wanted to travel, Napoleon?' I asked him as we drove back toward Johannesburg.</P>
<P>'Not much point in wishing, the way things are, suh!' he said.</P>
<P>'Whatta you mean?'</P>
<P>'My pass is only good for the Jo'burg area; if I ever be caught outside my zone I go to prison! I sure would like to go someplace though!'</P>
<P>'Where would you go!'</P>
<P>'I dunno, suh, never thought much about it!' Just being told he was confined to a certain area made him all the more wishful for the freedom to go. The problem was, he didn't know where he would go. He reminded me of a friend of mine who told me once about a party to which he hadn't been invited.</P>
<P>'I didn't want to go to the damn party in the first place, but I would have liked to have been invited.' he had said. Just human nature, I guess!</P>
<P>                                                  Tuesday, March 24th, 1964</P>
<P>A colour postcard with a Basuto woman stoking a fire below a large three-legged pot. She is barefoot but wears a cotton shirt and skirt and ornamental beads. Two little boys aged about two and six stand behind her, dressed in skimpy loincloths. Traditional thatch-roofed huts appear in the background.</P>

<P>Hi Gretchen!</P>
<P>                   This is a picture of little boys in Africa helping their Mommy to cook dinner. She is probably preparing Baked Alaska! Whom do you think she looks like most? Mommy? or Sharon? Send in your votes! Do you think you and Dougie would like to have Mommy cook dinner outside in a pot on the fireplace? And run around with no clothes on? Some fun, eh? Maybe you could have Cleo for dinner!  Ugh! I miss you all very much! Kiss Mommy and Dougie for me, please! Sharon, too, if Mommy will let you!</P>
<P>                                             Love, Daddy       xxxooo</P>

<P>One morning Fergie announced that it was a one-day holiday for school children and he was going to drive his two grandchildren up to the capital, Pretoria.</P>
<P>Great Britain acquired control of the Cape region following the Napoleonic Wars and British missionaries and thousands of British settlers migrated to South Africa. English was proclaimed the official language in 1822 and slavery was abolished in 1833. These and other British measures were bitterly resented by the Boers of the Cape and in a movement famous as the Great Trek about 10,000 Dutch settlers moved to regions north and east of the Orange River. Pretoria was established by Marthinus W. Pretorius in 1855 and named in honor of his father Andries, legendary Boer soldier and statesman.</P>
<P>Fergie's grandchildren were nine and ten years old and primarily interested in having me take their photos in front of a tall concrete spire. My primary interest was in the large life-size statue commemorating the original heroic 'Voortrekkers'. Grizzled Boers wearing their traditional floppy felt hats walked beside horse-drawn wagons bearing their women and their household effects, all looking forward to their new life and their 'Promised Land'.</P>
<P>                                                                 Saturday, March 28th, 1964</P>
<P>Colour postcard of a young (fourteen or fifteen years old) Bantu girl posed in a banana field with her left hand on a hoe and her right hand on a cluster of bananas. She is naked except for bracelets on her wrist and neck and a skimpy cotton loin cloth. Her naked breasts are as perfect and fully-developed as the bananas she is touching.</P>
<P>P.S. I'll miss this little girl! Yuk! Yuk!</P>
<P>Hi dear!</P>
<P>            Just received your letter telling of Dougie's accident. Poor little guy! I hope he acted bravely! Better give him a special kiss for me tonight. Had a marvellous week here and seemed to recover my former robust good health. Will leave for Nairobi in about an hour. Your letter took a week to reach here so you better allow at least that.</P>
<P>                                                   Much love to all, Ron.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">-o-</P>
<P>For some reason the airline was on the hook for my accommodation overnight in Nairobi. I must have been put up in a hotel but, try as I might, I can't remember a hotel of any kind! There are, however, some things I remember doing and , of course, some things I'm sure I didn't do. For instance, I'm sure I never met with Jomo Kenyatta! Kenya had been a republic for less than a year and Jomo, previous Mau Mau leader who had previously been interned by the British for revolutionary complicity had been elected President. I remember walking a block or so from the hotel I don't remember and strolling into an open-fronted beer parlour. I found an empty seat and sat down before I bothered to take a look around. I realized that I was the only white man present. That didn't phase me particularly and I ordered a beer without concern. I became concerned about half way through my beer when I realized that all conversation in the room had stopped and I was the cynosure of all eyes. Even though the Mau Mau atrocities had ended I felt decidedly unwelcome and finished my beer and strolled out of the parlour casually with my anal sphincter tight enough to squeak.</P>
<P>I remember signing up for a tour of the Narobi National Game Park and riding out among the incredible hordes of wildlife. Zebra and wildebeest predominated but other horned animals proliferated in abundance. I watch such a variety of photographic closeups these days on television that I don't remember what all I saw on the grasslands. I know I didn't see elephants and am sure I didn't see tigers or lions. Frankly, my best view of mature lions took place south of Los Angeles in 1961 at African Safari Park during Frazier's heyday. They even threw in a bonus of them copulating at the roadside!</P>
<P>I was told that the high altitude of the airstrip and the elevated temperature of the day made it difficult for heavily-loaded jets to get airborne before nightfall. As a result the terminal, virtually deserted during most of the day, was jammed to capacity in the evening. I figured that there was no way all of the bodies crammed into the terminal could be loaded on to the waiting aircraft until I realized that every East Indian headed for Bombay was accompanied to the airport by all of his friends and relations.</P>
