    <h3 class="storyTitle">ECHO:</h3>
    <p>We have a nervous time finding lights to warn passing ships when I go to one of the Caribbean islands to help Bob McCullough sail Echo to the Florida keys.</p>

    <h3 class="storyTitle">CYCLONE:</h3>
    <p>We are overtaken by a major hurricane and I stay on the tiller as first man there. Trying to change hands on the tiller could be disastrous in such seas. We are nearly turned turtle and the mess below is substantial. This was the worst of the storms we encountered.</p>

    <h3 class="storyTitle">SHIPWRECK:</h3>
    <p>Bill has been second-guessed till 'hell wouldn't have it' about the procedure he followed after sighting land. He has an unusual method of keeping watch; which includes taking the compass below and watching it occasionally to be sure the staysails don't backwind. I might not have taken such a leisurely approach, but he is the captain! The argument is moot!</p>

    <h3 class="storyTitle">NORMAN:</h3>
    <p>Norman Luxton was a Canadian who had sailed with Captain Voss in the early part of the century. Their sailboat was a second hand Indian dugout! He travelled from Banff to Calgary when I spoke to the Chamber of Commerce. His adventures are worth reading about.</p>
