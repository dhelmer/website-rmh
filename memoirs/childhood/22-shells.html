  <p>School board regulations in those days required that one be six years old before registration date on the first day of September. My birthday was December 28th, so I was not alowed to start school until the following year. I don't blame my mother if she thought it was a stupid rule. She was stuck with me for a further eight months and I was beholden to find redemptive activities for the same length of time.</p>
  <p>One of my first compensative activities was to strike up a relationship with Terry Wheatley, an equally mischievous little boy who lived east of us down the street across from Scarboro Church. They could have hooked up with the Methodists by that time, so it might have been Scarboro United Church.</p>
  <p>Terry had discovered a box of .22 calibre rifle shells in a box in his basement and naturally felt a compelling urge to put them to good use.</p>
  <p>'Just because we don't have a gun, it doesn't mean we can't use them,' he explained to me. 'If we put them on the front sidewalk and drop a big stone on them we should get a neat result.'</p>
  <p>'What if it works and one of us gets shot in the ankle?' I said, ever the thoughtful and cautious analyst.</p>
  <p>'I've got that all figgered out,' Terry said confidently. 'We time it so that when the rock hits the bullet we both jump up in the air. That way we we stay free and clear.'</p>
  <p>'Great! Let's do it,' I said.</p>
  <p>As a result, the sound sequence for the next half hour was approximately as follows: 'One,..two,..three,..Jump! Thump,..Crack! Zinnngg!</p>
  <p>Gee, that was great!' I exclaimed when we landed back on the sidewalk unscathed. Nevertheless, I had a growing feeling of uneasiness about the community acceptance of our new pastime. After the tenth successful launching, my enthusiasm was paling slightly.</p>
  <p>'I guess I'd better go home for lunch.' I said uneasily. 'I think my Mom is making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches,' I added gratuitously. (I didn't have a clue about what we might be having for lunch!)</p>
  <p>'Okay, see ya later,' Terry said unconcernedly, setting another shell in place. I ran home as fast as I could to avoid flying projectiles. I heard another distant 'Crack!' as I entered our front yard.</p>
  <p>Suspicions confirmed. When I told my mother what we had been doing she did precisely what the .22 shells had been doing...she went ballistic!</p>
  <p>'What on earth were you boys thinking? she cried. 'How did that boy get hold of bullets, anyway? Don't you realize how dangerous that was? Good Lord! It looks like I can't turn my back for ten minutes without you getting into some kind of mischief!'</p>
  <p>I kept chewing on my sandwich until she'd temporarily run out of breath, then volunteered an explanation.</p>
  <p>'Geez, Mom, it was perfectly safe. I told you that we jumped well clear every time we dropped the rock. Our timing was perfect!' That didn't work. I was banned from further association with Terry until further notice. I needed to find a new friend.</p>
